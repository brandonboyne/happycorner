        <h1> welcome to HAPPY CORNER </h1>
         <br> <P1> This is a story about boy who lived in a small island called jamaica all his life, until he travelled to New york <br> this was the first time he was travelling and so he was extremely amused by the way things were in this new place compared to his  home country. <br> He took lots of picture when went out and assembled them into two photo galleries so he could share his amazing journey with you.  </P1> <br> <br>
